# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with users to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible user module. For example:
#
# users:
#   - name: johnd
#     comment: John Doe
#     uid: 1040
#     group: admin

users: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `users` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible user module

users_defaults: {}

# Indicate `users` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host variable
# that begins with "users_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `users`
